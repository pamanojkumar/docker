#  docker with client server setup and todo
# client - will be created using create-react-app and setup the docker and code.
# server - python
# db - mongodb

# server setup
1. create docker, requirements.txt and app.py
2. docker build -t <image-name> .
3. docker images - will show the created image
4. docker run -p hostport:containerport --name <container name> <image-name>
    docker run -p 5000:5000 --name todo-ser todo-server
5. create docker-compose to hold all the details in one place and network on outside of server folder and run the below command.
docker-compose up --build

# client setup
1. install create-react-app
2. include dockerfile
3. include ignore like gitignore, dockerignore,yarn
4. add the details to docker compose file which is created commonl for both server and client in outside of client/server folder
5. yarn add axios

# image history
docker history imagename

# docket commit change and create new image

# push images into docker hub with imagename
1. docker tag <existing imageid> dockerhubid/reponame:tagname
2. docker login --username=<username>
